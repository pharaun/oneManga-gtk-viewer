Setup a rough design of the database:

1) Site information

2) Manga specific information

3) categories/other grouping information like author, artist, etc...

4) "page/chapter/volume" index for unusual URL, names/title of each
volume/page/etc that kind of stuff

Thus in the end will be able to query based on site, query based on category,
     author, artist.... 

     or query on I like XYZ manga, find me the site with the most up to date,
     etc..



a) Convert over to a sequel based database with sqlite as the backend
b) get the structure/cache/etc for this to work
c) proceed to finish up some of these following issues:

1) Get the manga index working
2) join up the index to the actual manga viewer stuff
3) begun constructing the plugin system for each "manga site"

4) cache backend
    - Its currently pretty stupid, just does a md5 hash of the key and stuff the value in that 
	file w/ that hash of the key

5) The http fetcher is also a bit dumb, need to look into multi-threading and rate limiters
6) create the database api for dealing with the db backend for manga data storage
7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that
