1) Get the manga index working
2) join up the index to the actual manga viewer stuff
3) begun constructing the plugin system for each "manga site"

4) cache backend

5) The http fetcher is also a bit dumb, need to look into multi-threading and rate limiters
6) create the database api for dealing with the db backend for manga data storage
7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that7) look into an image api/cache for image storage, might just reuse the "cache.rb" for that
